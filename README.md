# Chemical Representation Learning

### About
This repository contains the code for experimenting with various machine learning methods for chemistry. The current focus is on predicting yield by learning representations from chemical SMILES strings.

### How To Contribute
To contribute, please create a pull request. Your code should be reviewed and auto-tested before merging. 

Whenever possible, make sure that:
- Your code is well documented. All methods should have docstrings indicating what the function does, input and output data types, as well as in-line comments wherever needed.
- All methods you write are well-tested. (See the `tests/` folder)
